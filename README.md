## Projects
### All in One Robot Car
[Publication]http://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2405333.pdf

Led a team of two in developing a multifunctional robot car using Arduino Uno with features including obstacle avoidance, line following, Bluetooth control and Voice control. Created an app with MIT App Inventor for seamless mode switching (manual, voice, obstacle avoidance, line following), with line following algorithm obtaining 93% accuracy, earning significant university acclaim. Showcased expertise in robotics, mobile app development, and embedded systems.

### Electric Vehicle Battery Health Monitoring - Machine Learning

Managed a team of three in development of an LSTM-based model for monitoring electric vehicle battery health, focusing on data processing and feature engineering. Showed expertise in applying machine learning techniques to enhance battery health assessments in the EV industry, attaining 98% accuracy and supporting advancements in electric vehicle technology.

### Code AI - Full Stack Web Development

Directed a team of three in developing a Chat-GPT clone using ReactJS, integrating it with the Chat-GPT API to create a dynamic conversational platform. Elevated user interface with responsive design techniques, making it more approachable and easy to operate, hence improved user engagement and interaction by about 30%. Illustrated proficiency in full-stack development by managing both front-end and back-end aspects of project.
